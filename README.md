# Chess-Render-And-Game
This the start of my chess project to make something that you can play chess against. My idea was to initally make a bot, but i think i can take it a little further and make it into something alike an AI. I am just trying to get the logic of the peices together at the moment and also trying to get SDL / GLFW to work with my program for a flawless 2D rendering library.
